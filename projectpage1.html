                Rabbi Sydney Mintz wonders why so many Jews, non-Jews and wannabe Jews are completely mystified about
                who the Jews are, where we come from, where we’re going and how to get there. This lesbian Rabbi’s
                enthralling, differently gendered, seriously funny one-woman show will touch you in your kishkes, even
                if you don’t know what they are. <br><br>After 25 years as a rabbi at one of the largest congregations
                in the
                U.S, Sydney Mintz steps off the pulpit to share the uncensored, hilarious and deeply moving stories that
                have transformed her vision of the world. Punctuated with stranger-than-fiction visuals and stirring
                music, “You May Think I’m Funny…” takes the audience on a wild, moving, hilarious and fast-paced ride
                through the lens of a rabbi who is both devoted to her calling and constantly questioning what it all
                means.
